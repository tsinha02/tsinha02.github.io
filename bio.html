<h1>A Little About Me </h1>
<p>Hello, my name is Tanya Sinha and I am currently a student at Tufts University School of Engineering.
I am studying Computer Science and minoring in Engineering Mangement. At Tufts, I am part of a program 
called STOMP (Student Teacher Outreach Mentorship Program) where the main focus is to introduce different 
aspects of STEM education to elementary/middle school children. Each lesson requires the students to use  
the Engineering Design Process to solve problems. I have a lot of experience in teaching as I have taught 
children of all age groups in the last five years. I really enjoying teaching because it makes me feel as 
though I am giving back to my community. I also currently teach Math Olympiad at the International School 
of Boston. Teaching has been a major part of my career and I hope to make an impact on the students,     
especially girls who may be shy or feel inferior to their classmates. </p>
