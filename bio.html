<h1>Rolling in the Deep</h1>
<h2 id="artist">Adele</h2>

<p>Hello, my name is Tanya Sinha and I am currently a student at Tufts University School of Engineering.<br/>
I am studying Computer Science and minoring in Engineering Mangement. At Tufts, I am part of of a program <br/>
called STOMP (Student Teacher Outreach Mentorship Program) where the main focus is to introduce different <br/>
aspects of STEM education to elementary/middle school children. Each lesson requires the students to use  <br/>
the Engineering Design Process to solve problems. I have a lot of experience in teaching as I have taught <br/>
children of all age groups in the last five years. I really enjoying teaching because it makes me feel as <br/>
as thought I am giving back to my community. I also currently teach Math Olympiad at the International    <br/>
School of Boston. Teaching has been a major part of my career and I hope to have made an impact on the    <br/>
students, especially girls who may be shy or feel inferior to their classmates. </p>

<p> My hobbies including playing tennis and biking during the summer.
See how I'll leave with every piece of you<br/>
Don't underestimate the things that I will do<br/>
There's a fire starting in my heart<br/>
Reaching a fever pitch, and it's bringing me out the dark</p>

<p>The scars of your love remind me of us<br/>
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all<br/>
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless<br/>
I can't help feeling</p>

<p class="chorus">We could have had it all<br/>
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)<br/>
Rolling in the deep<br/>
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)<br/>
You had my heart inside of your hand<br/>
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)<br/>
And you played it to the beat<br/>
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)</p>

<p>Baby, I have no story to be told<br/>
But I've heard one on you<br/>
Now I'm gonna make your head burn<br/>
Think of me in the depths of your despair<br/>
Make a home down there<br/>
As mine sure won't be shared</p>

<p>(You're gonna wish you never had met me)<br/>
The scars of your love remind me of us<br/>
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)<br/>
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all<br/>
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)<br/>
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless<br/>
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)<br/>
I can't help feeling</p>

<p class="chorus">We could have had it all<br/>
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)<br/>
Rolling in the deep<br/>
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)<br/>
You had my heart inside of your hand<br/>
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)<br/>
And you played it to the beat<br/>
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)<br/>
Could have had it all<br/>
Rolling in the deep<br/>
You had my heart inside of your hand<br/>
But you played it with a beating</p>

<p>Throw your soul through every open door<br/>
Count your blessings to find what you look for<br/>
Turn my sorrow into treasured gold<br/>
You'll pay me back in kind and reap just what you sow</p>

<p class="chorus">(You're gonna wish you never had met me)<br/>
We could have had it all<br/>
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)<br/>
We could have had it all<br/>
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)<br/>
It all, it all, it all<br/>
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)</p>

<p class="chorus">We could have had it all<br/>
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)<br/>
Rolling in the deep<br/>
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)<br/>
You had my heart inside of your hand<br/>
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)<br/>
And you played it to the beat<br/>
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)</p>

<p class="chorus">We could have had it all<br/>
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)<br/>
Rolling in the deep<br/>
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)<br/>
You had my heart inside of your hand<br/>
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)<br/>
But you played it<br/>
You played it [x2]<br/>
You played it to the beat</p>
