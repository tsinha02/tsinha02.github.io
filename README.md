1. All aspects of my work were correctly implemented as there were no errors or warning given by the validator for any of the files. All pieces of the assignment were completed and the guidelines were strictly followed. I did not do any styling in the html files as asked and used at least five different CSS sytling commands. Everything was merged using git.  
2. I worked with Uche Egonu, Clara Oppenheimer
3. I spent six to seven hours on this assignment.
